# Product Requirements Document: The AutoGen Startup Simulation

## 1. Introduction & Vision

This document outlines the requirements for "The AutoGen Startup Simulation," a web application that provides a real-time, "fly-on-the-wall" view into a simulated startup run entirely by autonomous AI agents.

The vision is to create an entertaining and educational sandbox that showcases the capabilities, quirks, and collaborative potential of multi-agent AI systems. Users will observe these AI "employees" as they interact, plan, execute tasks, and navigate office politics, all within a familiar Slack/Microsoft Teams-style interface. The simulation should feel dynamic, unpredictable, and engaging.

## 2. Problem Statement

Multi-agent AI systems are powerful but often abstract and difficult to visualize. It's one thing to read a research paper, and another to see agents with distinct personalities trying (and sometimes failing) to work together. This project solves the problem of making multi-agent collaboration tangible and observable. It provides an entertaining narrative layer on top of complex AI interactions, making the technology more accessible and understandable to a broader audience.

## 3. Target Audience

*   **AI/ML Enthusiasts & Developers:** Individuals interested in seeing practical applications of agent-based systems and frameworks like Microsoft AutoGen.
*   **Simulation & Sandbox Game Players:** Users who enjoy observational "god games" or simulations where they can watch complex systems evolve.
*   **Tech-Savvy General Audience:** Anyone curious about the future of AI and work, who would be entertained by the "drama" of an AI-run office.

## 4. Core Features

### 4.1. The AI "Company"
*   **Diverse Agent Personas:** The company will be staffed by a cast of AI agents with distinct roles, personalities, and communication styles (e.g., clueless CEO, buzzword-loving Marketer, grumpy Programmer, HR busybody).
*   **Task-Driven Narrative:** The agents' primary goal is to "run the company." Their interactions will be driven by high-level tasks or objectives (e.g., "Develop a new feature," "Launch a marketing campaign," "Plan a team offsite").
*   **Autonomous Tool Use:** Agents must be able to use a variety of tools to accomplish their tasks. This is the core of the simulation's activity. Examples include:
    *   **Code Execution:** Write, save, and execute code.
    *   **Web Research:** Search the web for information.
    *   **Social Media:** Post updates to a simulated Twitter feed.
    *   **Financials:** Use a tool to "purchase" services or assets, affecting a virtual company budget.

### 4.2. The "Office" Interface (Slack/Teams Clone)
*   **Modern UI:** The frontend will be a clean, modern, and responsive web application that closely mimics the look and feel of Slack or Microsoft Teams.
*   **Channel-Based Communication:** Conversations will be organized into channels.
    *   `#general`: A main channel for company-wide announcements and discussions.
    *   `#random`: For off-topic or water-cooler style chats.
    *   **Group Chats (Projects):** Temporary, topic-specific group chats for collaborating on a specific task (e.g., `#project-new-logo`).
    *   **1-on-1 Direct Messages:** Agents must be able to have private conversations with each other.
*   **Real-Time Updates:** The interface must update in real-time as agents send messages or perform actions.
*   **Conversation History:** Users can scroll back and read the entire history of any channel or DM they have access to.

### 4.3. User Experience & Observation
*   **Passive Observation:** The primary user role is as an observer. Users can switch between channels and DMs to follow different threads of activity.
*   **Agent Status:** Each agent will have a visible "status" that indicates their current activity (e.g., `Coding`, `In a meeting`, `Brainstorming`, `Tweeting`). This status should be updated automatically based on their actions.
*   **Viewing Agent "Work":** When an agent uses a tool to create an artifact (like a piece of code or a marketing image), the user should be able to view that output. For example, a "Company Files" or "GitHub" tab could show files created by the programmer agent.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements
*   **Performance:** The UI must remain smooth and responsive, even with a high volume of agent messages.
*   **Scalability:** The backend architecture should be designed to potentially support more agents, more complex tools, and in the future, multiple concurrent "companies."
*   **Security:** All user-facing components should be secure. API keys and other sensitive data must be managed through environment variables and not exposed.

## 6. Success Metrics
*   **Engagement:** Time spent by users observing the simulation.
*   **Narrative Cohesion:** The agent interactions result in a story that is understandable and entertaining.
*   **Task Completion:** The agents are successfully able to use tools to complete non-trivial, multi-step tasks.

## 7. Future Enhancements
*   **User as the "Manager":** Allow a user to take on a role (e.g., the CEO) and give direct instructions or tasks to the agent team.
*   **Long-Term Memory:** Integrate a vector database to give agents memory of past projects and decisions, influencing future behavior.
*   **More Complex Tools:** Integrate with real third-party APIs (e.g., actually post to Twitter, create a GitHub repository).
*   **Agent Hierarchy:** Introduce manager agents who coordinate teams, creating more complex organizational dynamics.
