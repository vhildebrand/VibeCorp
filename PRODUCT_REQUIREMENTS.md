# Product Requirements Document: The AutoGen Startup Simulation

## 1. Introduction & Vision

This document outlines the requirements for "The AutoGen Startup Simulation," a web application that provides a real-time, "fly-on-the-wall" view into a simulated startup run entirely by autonomous AI agents.

The vision is to create an entertaining and educational sandbox that showcases the capabilities, quirks, and collaborative potential of multi-agent AI systems. Users will observe AI "employees" as they are assigned a high-level goal, form a company, devise a product, and attempt to build it. The simulation should feel dynamic, unpredictable, and engaging, driven by the agents' internal goals and emergent collaboration.

## 2. Problem Statement

Multi-agent AI systems are powerful but often abstract and difficult to visualize. It's one thing to read a research paper, and another to see agents with distinct personalities trying (and sometimes failing) to work together towards a common goal. This project solves the problem of making multi-agent collaboration tangible and observable. It provides an entertaining narrative layer on top of complex AI interactions, making the technology more accessible and understandable to a broader audience.

## 3. Target Audience

*   **AI/ML Enthusiasts & Developers:** Individuals interested in seeing practical applications of agent-based systems and frameworks like Microsoft AutoGen.
*   **Simulation & Sandbox Game Players:** Users who enjoy observational "god games" or simulations where they can watch complex systems evolve.
*   **Tech-Savvy General Audience:** Anyone curious about the future of AI and work, who would be entertained by the "drama" of an AI-run office.

## 4. Core Features

### 4.1. The AI "Company" & Agent Autonomy
*   **Diverse Agent Personas:** The company will be staffed by a cast of AI agents with distinct roles, personalities, and capabilities (e.g., CEO, Project Manager, Frontend Developer, Backend Developer, Marketer, HR Manager).
*   **Goal-Driven Narrative:** The simulation starts with a high-level goal (e.g., "Build a SaaS product for social media managers"). The agents' primary objective is to achieve this goal. Their interactions—from initial brainstorming to final product—will be emergent and unscripted.
*   **Individual Task Management:** Each agent must maintain its own internal to-do list or task queue. This list drives their actions. An agent decides what to do next based on its own priorities, capabilities, and messages received from other agents.
*   **Autonomous Tool Use:** Agents must be able to use a variety of tools to accomplish their tasks. This is the core of the simulation's activity. The toolset must be robust and versatile.
    *   **Code Generation:** Write, save, and test new code.
    *   **File System Access:** Read and write to files to manage a project codebase.
    -   **Web Research:** Search the web for information (e.g., market research, technical documentation).
    *   **Social Media:** Prepare content for a simulated Twitter feed.
    -   **Task Management:** Agents must be able to add, remove, and reprioritize tasks on their own to-do lists and assign tasks to other agents.

### 4.2. The "Office" Interface (Slack/Teams Clone)
*   **Modern UI:** The frontend will be a clean, modern, and responsive web application that closely mimics the look and feel of Slack or Microsoft Teams.
*   **Organic Communication:** Conversations will be organized into channels and direct messages. Communication is not turn-based; agents can send messages whenever it is relevant to their current task or a message they have received.
    *   `#general`: A main channel for company-wide announcements and discussions.
    *   `#engineering`: For technical discussions and code-related collaboration.
    *   **Direct Messages:** Agents must be able to have private conversations with each other to ask questions, assign tasks, or collaborate.
*   **Real-Time Updates:** The interface must update in real-time as agents send messages or perform actions.
*   **Conversation History:** Users can scroll back and read the entire history of any channel or DM.

### 4.3. User Experience & Observation
*   **Passive Observation:** The primary user role is as an observer. Users can switch between channels and DMs to follow different threads of activity.
*   **Agent Status & To-Do List:** Each agent will have a visible "status" indicating their current activity (e.g., `Coding`, `Researching`, `Replying to message`). Critically, the user must also be able to view each agent's current to-do list to understand their motivations and plans.
*   **Viewing Agent "Work":** When an agent uses a tool to create an artifact (like a piece of code), the user should be able to view that output in a dedicated "Company Files" or "Codebase" section of the UI.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements
*   **Performance:** The UI must remain smooth and responsive, even with a high volume of agent messages.
*   **Scalability:** The backend architecture should be designed to support more agents, more complex tools, and a more complex agent interaction model.
*   **Security:** All user-facing components should be secure. API keys and other sensitive data must be managed through environment variables and not exposed.

## 6. Success Metrics
*   **Engagement:** Time spent by users observing the simulation.
*   **Narrative Cohesion:** The agent interactions result in a story that is understandable and entertaining.
*   **Task Completion:** The agents are successfully able to use tools to complete non-trivial, multi-step tasks.

## 7. Future Enhancements
*   **User as the "Manager":** Allow a user to take on a role (e.g., the CEO) and give direct instructions or tasks to the agent team.
*   **Long-Term Memory:** Integrate a vector database to give agents memory of past projects and decisions, influencing future behavior.
*   **More Complex Tools:** Integrate with real third-party APIs (e.g., actually post to Twitter, create a GitHub repository).
*   **Agent Hierarchy:** Introduce manager agents who coordinate teams, creating more complex organizational dynamics.
